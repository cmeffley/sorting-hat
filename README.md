# Hogwarts Sorting Hat
This site allows you to enter your name and be randomly assigned to a Hogwarts house!

Site address:
https://cm-sorting-hat.netlify.app/

You start by clicking the Let's Sort button. Then you must enter your name, otherwise an alert pops up and asks you to enter a name. Once you have typed in your name, click the Sort! button. You will be randomly assigned to a Hogwarts house and a card will pop up with your name and house name on it. If you are causing too much trouble and get Expelled, you will click the Expel button and your card will disappear.
